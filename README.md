# Presidential-Speeches
A small project where I look at major presidential speeches, and measure their flesch-kincaid grade level to look for trends 
Information on the flesch-kincaid model: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests 
Raw data source for the presidental speeches: https://millercenter.org/presidential-speeches-downloadable-data 

This project relies on another project I am working on to find the number of syllables in an english word. There is no concrete rule set for how english syllables are constructed, 
so i decided to try and take a machine learning approach. Project can be found here: https://github.com/roseAzizi/English-Syllable-Finder
